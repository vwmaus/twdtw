Description: Implements Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW), a measure for time series similarities. TWDTW is applicable to multi-dimensional time series with various resolutions, making it highly suited for environmental and ecological data analysis, such as remote sensing imagery, climate data, hydrology, or animal movement. The package provides a user-friendly R interface, efficient Fortran routines for TWDTW calculations, flexible time weighting definition, utilities for time series preprocessing, and visualization.
